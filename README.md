Shippensburg University Shell

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a programmer, I recently took on the challenge of creating a basic shell using C. Let me tell you, it was no small feat. However, I am proud to say that I have successfully implemented several built-in commands, including cd, path, and exit. These commands, which are integral to any shell, allow users to change directories, manipulate the path environment variable, and exit the shell respectively.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my project doesn't stop there. I also made sure to add the functionality for executing non built-in commands, which is a crucial feature of any shell. This was achieved by using paths that start in '/bin'. As a result, users can easily run commands like 'ls', 'grep', or 'cat' from within the shell.
